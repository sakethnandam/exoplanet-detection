Specific Aim #1.2: Accessing the raw light curve data
Using the lightkurve Python package, download the Kepler/TESS light curves, or open and run the file located in the GitHub repository as “gettingData.ipynb”.
Save all files into a local directory on TIKE (this is already done if you run the Python script, “gettingData.ipynb”).
